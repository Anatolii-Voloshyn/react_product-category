# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In this project, I created a full-stack React application where you can filter products.
You can filter by name of a user, by product category, or find by name. Also, you can reset all filters or only by the user or category of the product.
